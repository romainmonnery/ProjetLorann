	Be aware of the fact that most of the time our group has been working on the same computer. The amount of commit in the github server might not be representative of the amount of work provided by each member of the group.
To lauch our project be sure to have JRE 1.8 and JDK 1.8 versions.
	Then you will need to have the same SQL base as we have.  Be sure that it's the case by creating a Data base named "lorann" then lauching the SQL script (lorann.sql) on your PHPmyAdmin (Wamp server).
You can find this script in the "livrables".
	Also, we did not succeed in making maven dependencies working.  In order to launch the game, you will have to import the Maven project Lorann and launch the main class from the main package.
